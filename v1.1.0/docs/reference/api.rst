APIs
====

Here you'll find the API docs to the Python scripts.

Typically they are not exposed through Python's ``import`` statements, a
"How To" or "Getting Started" will be written soon about it.

But for the time being, if you ever come across those objects, you will find
information about their methods and attributes here.
